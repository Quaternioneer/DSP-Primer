//Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm

algorithm iterative-fft is
    input: Array a of n complex values where n is a power of 2.
    output: Array A the DFT of a.
 
    bit-reverse-copy(a, A)
    n ← a.length 
    for s = 1 to log(n) do
        m ← 2s
        ωm ← exp(−2πi/m) 
        for k = 0 to n-1 by m do
            ω ← 1
            for j = 0 to m/2 – 1 do
                t ← ω A[k + j + m/2]
                u ← A[k + j]
                A[k + j] ← u + t
                A[k + j + m/2] ← u – t
                ω ← ω ωm
   
    return A
